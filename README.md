# LinkUp

LinkUp is an innovative application designed to facilitate seamless sharing of photos and videos through links. At its current stage, the application is under active development, and this README provides a brief overview of the project.

## Features

- **Media Sharing**: Users can effortlessly upload photos or videos to the application and generate shareable links for easy distribution.

- **Link-based Sharing**: Sharing media is as simple as creating a link. Users can share the generated links with others, allowing them to access the shared content directly.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: The backend logic is implemented with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) to handle file uploads, link generation, and other server-side functionalities.
